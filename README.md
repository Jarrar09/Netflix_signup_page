# Netflix Sign-Up Page Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the Netflix sign-up page, built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the design and layout of Netflix's sign-up interface, focusing on creating a responsive and visually appealing page that mirrors the original.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Modern Layout**: The design closely mimics the Netflix sign-up page, with a sleek and clean interface.
- **Form Validation (Optional)**: Basic client-side validation can be added for email input and password fields (using HTML5 and CSS).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the sign-up page.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsive design to match Netflix's branding and visual aesthetics.
